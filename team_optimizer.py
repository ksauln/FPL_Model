This script is a `TeamOptimizer` class designed to optimize the selection of a Fantasy Premier League (FPL) team for an upcoming game week. The optimizer uses linear programming to maximize predicted points while adhering to a set of constraints, such as budget limits and required player positions. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key functions:

### Key Components and Their Functions:

1. **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
   - Initializes the class but does not include any custom parameters at this stage.

2. **Team Selection Optimization (`optimize_team_selection`)**:
   - This function is responsible for selecting the optimal team of players based on predicted points and various constraints, such as budget and player positions.

   **Process Overview**:
   - **Inputs**:
     - `upcoming_game_week_data`: A dataframe containing player data, including costs, predicted points, and positions.
     - `budget`: The maximum budget for selecting players (default is 100).
   
   **Steps**:
   - Extracts relevant information from the data:
     - `player_costs`: Array of player costs.
     - `player_points`: Array of predicted points for each player.
     - `player_positions`: Array of player positions (GK, DEF, MID, FWD).
   - Sets up the objective function (`c`), which aims to **maximize predicted points** by minimizing the negative of the points.
   - Adds constraints:
     - **Budget constraint**: Ensures that the total cost of selected players does not exceed the budget.
     - **Position constraints**: Ensures the team adheres to specific position counts (e.g., 2 goalkeepers, 5 defenders, etc.). These are defined in `POSITION_COUNTS`.
   - Uses linear programming (`linprog`) to solve the problem:
     - `A_ub` and `b_ub` matrices define the upper bounds for the constraints (budget and position limits).
     - `bounds`: Each player can either be selected (1) or not selected (0).
   - Solves the linear programming problem using the "highs" method, which is efficient for this type of optimization.
   - Returns an array (`selected_players`) that indicates which players have been selected (1 for selected, 0 for not selected).

3. **Prepare Selected Team (`prepare_selected_team`)**:
   - This function takes the selected players and formats the data to display the final optimized team in a readable format.
   
   **Process Overview**:
   - **Inputs**:
     - `upcoming_game_week_data`: The same player data used in the optimization step.
     - `selected_players`: The binary array returned by `optimize_team_selection` indicating which players are selected.
     - `teams`: A dataframe containing team data, including team IDs and names.
   - Filters the `upcoming_game_week_data` to include only the selected players.
   - Merges this filtered data with the `teams` dataframe to include additional information, such as the team name and the opposing team's name for each selected player.
   - Maps position codes to text descriptions using `POSITION_MAPPING` (e.g., 'GK' for goalkeeper, 'DEF' for defender).
   - Converts home/away status to a readable format ('H' for home, 'A' for away).
   - Selects relevant columns to display using `DISPLAY_COLUMNS` and renames them according to `COLUMN_DISPLAY_MAPPING` to ensure consistency in the output format.
   - Returns the final formatted team dataframe sorted by predicted points in descending order.

4. **Optimize (`optimize`)**:
   - The main function that ties together the optimization and preparation steps.
   
   **Process Overview**:
   - **Inputs**:
     - `upcoming_game_week_data`: The data containing player predictions, costs, and positions.
     - `teams`: The team data used for merging and formatting.
     - `budget`: The total budget for selecting players (default 100).
   - Calls `optimize_team_selection` to perform the linear programming optimization and get the selected players.
   - Passes the selected players to `prepare_selected_team` to prepare the final team for display.
   - Returns the optimized team.

### Summary:
This class performs a **team optimization** process for FPL based on predicted points, budget, and position constraints. It uses **linear programming** to maximize the team's predicted points within the specified budget and ensures that the selected team meets the required position counts. The final team is formatted and returned in a readable format, including player details and their respective home/away status. This method allows for efficient, automated team selection for upcoming game weeks.
